Goals:
* click to activate
* show active trail
* new depths are revealed using slide animation
* make options so that menu is framework-agnostic
* include some basic options for color
* include a few event callbacks

TODO:
* ~~have js add helper classes to primary and secondary menus to avoid overuse of direct descendent selector~~
* ~~clean up styling~~
* figure out how to have dynamic css classes based on options
* integrate event handlers into class definition
