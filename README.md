Horizontal Menu
===============

Goals:
* click to activate
* show active trail
* new depths are revealed using slide animation
* make options so that menu is framework-agnostic
* include a few event callbacks

TODO:
* ~~have js add helper classes to primary and secondary menus to avoid overuse of direct descendent selector~~
* ~~clean up styling~~
* ~~apply css classes based on options~~
* ~~add namespaced active trail class~~
* ~~integrate event handlers into class definition~~
* ~~add event callbacks~~
* allow multiple depths of items
