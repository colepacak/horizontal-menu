Horizontal Menu
===============

Goals:
* click to activate
* new depths are revealed using slide animation
* make options so that menu is framework-agnostic
* include a few event callbacks
* show active trail

TODO:
* show active trail
  * setting the active trail on active needs to be promise driven since the
  height of ancestor bars dictate bar placement
* remove unused/unnecessary method/functions
* see where menu methods could be pushed to other protos
